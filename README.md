# HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various HackerRank coding problems. Each solution is organized in its own directory with a `solution.py` file.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Save The Prisoner
- **Directory**: `save-the-prisoner/`
- **Problem**: Determine the last prisoner to receive a candy in a circular distribution
- **Solution**: Mathematical approach using modulo arithmetic

### 2. Number of Items
- **Directory**: `number-of-items/`
- **Problem**: Find the number of items in a collection
- **Status**: Passed most test cases, failed on time for a few edge cases

### 3. Minimal Heaviest Set A
- **Directory**: `minimalHeaviestSetA/`
- **Problem**: Find the minimal heaviest set A from a given array
- **Solution**: Greedy approach with sorting and cumulative sum comparison

## How to Use

Each solution directory contains a `solution.py` file that can be run independently. The solutions follow HackerRank's standard input/output format.

### Running a Solution

```bash
cd <problem-directory>
python solution.py
```

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: All solutions are written in Python 3
- **Git**: Version control for tracking solution progress

## Problem Categories

- **Algorithms**: Mathematical and algorithmic problems
- **Data Structures**: Array manipulation and optimization
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Optimal local choices for global solutions

## Notes

- Solutions are tested against HackerRank's test cases
- Some solutions may have time complexity optimizations needed for edge cases
- All solutions follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines
